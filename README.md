Backend Database Design with Django and REST API
Project Name: Voting Application
This project focuses on creating a backend for a Voting Application where users can cast their votes for candidates. It involves robust database design, secure user authentication, and real-time vote management. Here's the thought process and implementation plan.

Approach and Development Steps
Model Design:
Begin by designing the necessary database models in the models.py file to define the structure of your application.

Admin Registration:
Import the models into the admin.py file and register them to leverage Django's admin panel for managing the data.

Database Migration:
Run makemigrations and migrate commands to apply your model changes and create the necessary database tables.

Serialization:
Use a serializers.py file for converting data into JSON format, ensuring reusability and maintainability of the code.

API Development:
Implement business logic for the application either within the views.py file or a separate API-specific file for better organization.

URL Routing:
Define endpoints in urls.py to make the application’s functionality accessible.

Key Functionalities
User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in with a unique identifier such as their Aadhaar number. Password reset functionality is also supported.
Candidate Management: Users can view the list of candidates available for voting.
Voting System: Each user can vote for one candidate only. Post-voting, the user cannot cast another vote.
Live Vote Count: Display real-time vote counts for each candidate.
Role-Based Access:
Users: Can vote and view candidates.
Admin: Maintains the candidate table but is restricted from voting.
Secure Data Handling: Ensure that Aadhaar numbers are unique and sensitive data is well-protected.
Advantages of the Design
Reusability: Using serializers makes the data processing reusable across multiple views and endpoints.
Security: Django's built-in authentication system ensures secure handling of user data.
Scalability: The application design can handle an increasing number of users and candidates by using optimized queries and caching.
